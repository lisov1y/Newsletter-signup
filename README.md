# Newsletter signup

A simple application that subscribes you to a newsletter that doesn't exist. This is my first app deployed on Heroku.
My deployed version is [here](https://salty-mountain-65830.herokuapp.com/).

### Usage

Firstly, you have to initialize npm in the root of the project.

```sh
$ npm init
```

Download necessary packages.

```sh
$ npm i express body-parser @mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing
```
